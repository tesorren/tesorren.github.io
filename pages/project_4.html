    <h1>Graduting Highschool Soon? Here are some tips to save money during college.</h1>
    <h2>By Renci Tesorero for Katz Daily Published 9 May 2024 </h2>
    <p>Preparing for college can be stressful. Your time is shorter and scheduling can be tough.  Classes are faster-paced and involve more materials. The thought of starting college can be stressful for some incoming students. So, the last thing you want is to be stressed about your financial situation too.</p>
    <p>Financial Well-being is an important aspect of your journey to college. You can think of Financial Well-being as your confidence level with how you handle your money. You use your credit card, debit card, and cash to pay for your school supplies, groceries, decorations for your dorm, snacks, and more.</p>
    <p>As such, the amount of funds you have is important to maintain, and having smaller funds can cause future problems which can give you more stress. To avoid these situations, you can make good financial decisions to help maintain your funds. The more money you have, the less to worry about, financially at least.</p>
    <h3>Here are some financial decisions that can help save you money in college.</h3>
    <h3>1. Budgeting</h3>

    <p>From a simple pie chart to using budgeting apps, creating a budget provides many useful benefits. For those who learn better visually, creating a budget can help to see what your expenses are going to be. </p>
    <p>Budgeting also shows how much you’re spending and what items you need to reduce spending on. Budgeting beforehand can help prevent overspending since you would know how much you can spend.</p>
    <h3>2. Have an Emergency Fund</h3>

    <p>Budgeting is a great way to prevent overspending in the long run but sometimes, unpredictable things can happen. Maybe you overspent, your car broke down, and other unexpected events happened. </p>
    <p>Having an emergency fund can reduce the hassle of finding the necessary funds to pay for these unanticipated expenses. This can also help avoid overdraft fees if you use a debit card.</p>
    <h3>3. Discounts, Limited-Time Sales, and Alternatives</h3>

    <p>Food is a necessary item to get the body moving so spending on groceries is unavoidable. Luckily, there are some ways to save money buying these items. Using store discounts is a good way to reduce the cost of an item. </p>
    <p>Sometimes, stores offer limited-time sales when there are events or holidays so take advantage of those as well. </p>
    <p>Finally, if no discounts and sales are available, look for alternatives. Store brands are usually cheaper than named brands but would function about the same.</p>
    <h3>4. Minimize Nonessential Spending</h3>

    <p>One of the best things about going to college is meeting new people and going out with them to get food, go to parties, give gifts, and try out other fun things. But remember that college is expensive and going out too much will consume your funds faster. So try to spend wisely.</p>
    <h3>5. Use “Pay-Later” Apps</h3>

    <p>Sometimes, you might need to purchase high-priced items, and your current funds might not be enough to pay for the full price. Thankfully, some website uses “Pay-Later” vendors like Klarna or PayPal which can divide the price into segments with little to no interest.</p>
    <p>Amazon credit cards also offer to divide payment by months at the cost of a fee. </p>
    <p>Keep in mind though that this does not reduce your payment but gives you ample time to get the necessary funds to pay fully. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>There are many ways you can save money. Decisions like creating a budget, using discounts, finding cheaper alternatives, cutting costs, or using pay-later apps can help prolong your funds and alleviate the burden of financial stress increasing your financial well-being.</p>
    <p>But no matter how much you find discounts and great deals, the financial decision of not spending will make or break the amount of money you save.</p>
